	<!--A story about the horror behind the Stanley Hotel-->
	
	<h1>What makes the Stanley Hotel so scary?</h1>
		<p>The hotel was opened in 1909 by the couple, F.O. and
		Flora Stanley. It was originally opened to be a secluded,
		grand mountain restort. The Stanleys have passes but <b> 
		many </b> believe that they never actually left. There have 
		been many haunted events that have caused people to believe
		this. In 1911, a housekeeper was electrocuted during a lightening
		storm in room 217. She was not killed but that room has become
		a center of paranormal activity. The hotel is considered one
		of the scariest places in the US. The novel, <i> The
		Shinning </i> was inspired by the events that Stephen
		King experienced when he stayed at the hotel. For $50 you
		are able to take part in a 5-hour ghost hunt at the hotel
		led by a paranormal investigator.</p>

	<h3>Reviews from people who have been here
	before</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>"My family wanted to take a vacation this Halloween 
		and everyone is into haunted things. We figured that the Stanley
		Hotel would be best for us so we took the challenge. Although we did 
		not stay in room 217, it was for sure a thrill. I would not recommend
		for someone to stay at this hotel if they are afraid of their own shadow.
		Our family did the ghost hunt which made it very difficult going to sleep
		that night. I would definitely go back again and hopefully be able to stay
		room 217."
		
		<li>My husband and I had begun to plan our honeymoon and we knew that we wanted
		to do something different. We both <b>LOVED </b> haunted houses which is how we
		met. Together we decided that it would be fun to put a twist on our honey moon 
		and to go to the Stanley Hotel. We were able to stay in room 217 which made our 
		stay so much more enjoyable... and scary. My husband and I did the 5-hour ghost
		hunt. Although we could not let go of each other because we were so scared, it 
		was such a good experience. While the hotel was very scary to stay at the sights
		around the area in Estes Park were gorgeous. All in all, my husband and I had a great
		stay and would be sure to go back again in the future. </li>
